Input: arr[]  = {1, 3, 0, 2};
Output: arr[] = {2, 0, 3, 1};
Explanation for the above output.
Since arr[0] is 1, arr[1] is changed to 0
Since arr[1] is 3, arr[3] is changed to 1
Since arr[2] is 0, arr[0] is changed to 2
Since arr[3] is 2, arr[2] is changed to 3


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int arr[]={2, 0, 1, 4, 5, 3};
    int len = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(arr[0]);
    int temp[100]={0};
  
   for(int i=0;i<len;i++)
   {
       temp[arr[i]]=i;
   }
   for(int i=0;i<len;i++)
   {
       printf("%d ",temp[i]);
   }
    return 0;
}
